*Guestbook / Journal – A simple application that can be for online that can allow people to add comments or
write journal entries. It can allow comments or not and timestamps all entries. Could also be made into a shout box.

*TV Show Tracker – Got a favorite show you don’t want to miss? Don’t have a PVR or want to be able to find the 
show to then PVR it later? Make an application which can search various online TV Guide sites, locate the 
shows/times/channels and add them to a database application. The database/website then can send you email 
reminders that a show is about to start and which channel it will be on.

*Travel Planner System – Make a system that allows users to put together their 
own little travel itinerary and keep track of the airline / hotel arrangements, points of interest,
budget and schedule.

* Absence Request and Vacation Schedule Management
